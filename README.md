## [!] Easy Installation

Double-click `build.bat`.

### 2. Install
Double-click `Install.bat`.
*   It will automatically find your game and copy the files.
*   If it asks for permission, say **Yes** (this is for the Registry Fix to bypass signature checks).

*   **Press F5** to open the Mod Menu.
*   **Settings:** Set in-game **Resolution Scale to 50%** and mode to **Borderless Windowed**.
